This project comes from the fact that I wanted to compare C with Rust with more or less the same concept program

Not only in C took less time to write,but also less lines of code and a way more easier aproach to the problem itself

Who the fuck need abstraction btw ?


It's pretty simple as now and I know it'll take time,but I want to improve it while keeping it S a n i c.

(So far even .iso files (Linux distros not Windows) are pretty fast imho)

I've recived some feedback from the previous attempt in Rust and my idea of config file was totally wrong

So I'll try to rewrite something similar,but less invasive

I'm open to suggestions


(Windows implementation will come,but not now)
